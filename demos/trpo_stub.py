"""TRPO algorithm stub.

Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) is mentioned in the paper as an
alternative RL fine-tuning method. A full implementation is far beyond a
minimal demo, so this script walks through the *ideas* step-by-step,
annotated with code placeholders.

Running this file simply prints the algorithmic outline so learners can
read it.

    TRPO Core Steps
    ----------------
    1. Collect trajectories with current policy π_θ.
    2. Estimate advantage Â(s,a) via GAE or Monte-Carlo.
    3. Compute policy gradient g = E[Â ∇_θ log π_θ].
    4. Compute Fisher-information matrix F.
    5. Solve constrained optimization:
         maximize   g^T Δθ
         subject to Δθ^T F Δθ ≤ δ   (trust-region radius).
       (Usually via conjugate-gradient + line-search.)
    6. Update θ ← θ + Δθ.
    7. Repeat.

    In practice libraries like stable-baselines3 or RLlib provide TRPO.
    This repo focuses on conceptual clarity—see PPO/RLHF demos for a
    runnable alternative.
